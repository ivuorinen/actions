# Quality Standards and Communication Guidelines

## Critical Quality Standards

### ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

- **ANY failing tests** = Project is NOT production ready
- **ANY linting issues** = Project is NOT production ready
- **NO EXCEPTIONS** to these rules

### Production Ready Definition

A project is only production ready when:

- ALL tests pass (100% success rate)
- ALL linting passes with zero issues
- ALL validation checks pass
- NO warnings or errors in any tooling

### Communication Style

- **Tone down language** - avoid excessive enthusiasm or verbose descriptions
- Be direct and factual
- Don't claim success until ALL issues are resolved
- Don't use terms like "production ready" unless literally everything passes
- Focus on facts, not marketing language

### Work Standards

- Fix ALL issues before declaring completion
- Never compromise on quality standards
- Test everything thoroughly
- Maintain zero-defect mentality
- Quality over speed

This represents the user's absolute standards for code quality and communication.
