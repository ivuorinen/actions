## Medium Priority Tasks 📋

### Language-Specific Improvements

- [ ] **Improve PHP Action Robustness** (Quality - Medium Effort)
  - Add Composer version detection and management
  - Improve Laravel-specific features
  - Add support for different PHP testing frameworks
  - Target: `php-*` actions

- [ ] **Enhance Python Actions** (Feature - Medium Effort)
  - Add Poetry support alongside pip
  - Improve virtual environment handling
  - Add support for pyproject.toml configuration
  - Target: `python-*` actions

### Workflow Improvements

- [ ] **Enhance Release Automation** (Feature - Medium Effort)
  - Improve automatic changelog generation
  - Add semantic version bumping
  - Enhance tag creation and release notes
  - Target: `github-release`, `release-monthly` actions

## Low Priority Tasks 🔮

### New Actions & Features

- [ ] **Create Rust Language Support Actions** (Feature - Large Effort)
  - Add `rust-version-detect`, `rust-lint`, `rust-build` actions
  - Support for Cargo and Rust ecosystem tools

- [ ] **Add Database Migration Actions** (Feature - Large Effort)
  - Create actions for database schema validation
  - Add migration running and rollback capabilities
  - Support for common databases

- [ ] **Create Security Scanning Actions** (Security - Large Effort)
  - Add dependency vulnerability scanning beyond MegaLinter
  - Create SAST integration
  - Add secret scanning capabilities

### Advanced Features

- [ ] **Add Action Composition Framework** (Feature - Large Effort)
  - Create meta-actions that compose multiple existing actions
  - Add conditional execution based on repository content

- [ ] **Implement Action Analytics** (Feature - Large Effort)
  - Add usage tracking and analytics
  - Create insights dashboard

## Missing Integration Tests (40 actions) 🔗

Only `version-file-parser` has integration tests. Need integration tests for all other 40 actions:

- [ ] All actions except version-file-parser need integration test workflows

## Next Steps 🚀

- [ ] Create integration test templates/patterns for missing actions
- [ ] Prioritize which actions need integration tests first (most critical/frequently used)
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure for actions that need external dependencies
- [ ] Consider fixing testing framework environment setup for cleaner unit test reports

## Success Metrics 📊

### Current Status

- **Self-Containment**: 100% achieved ✅
- **External Usage**: All 40 actions work as `ivuorinen/actions/action-name@main` ✅
- **SHA Pinning**: 27/27 external dependencies pinned ✅
- **Token Handling**: Standardized across all actions ✅
- **Token Interpolation**: Fixed critical GitHub Actions expression issues ✅
- **Action Catalog**: Automated generation system implemented ✅
- **Linting Configuration**: All project files pass linting (0 errors) ✅
- **Documentation Generation**: All READMEs properly generated with correct examples ✅
- **Bash Error Handling**: Implemented in all shell-based actions ✅
- **Input Validation**: 22/22 actions requiring validation (100% complete) ✅
- **Test Coverage**: Not yet measured
- **Performance**: Baseline established

### Target Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ for all actions
- **Input Validation**: 100% of actions ✅
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >70% for dependency caches
- **Action Execution Time**: 20% improvement through optimization
